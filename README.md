### About These Notes

I'm currently pursuing a PhD in theoretical computer science. As I started exploring machine learning, I often struggled to find resources that were both clear and comprehensive. Many notes were either too informal to be useful for in depth understanding, or too dense to absorb quickly.

This repository is my attempt to create what I wish I had:
-  Concise, intuitive explanations that capture the core ideas  
-  Formal definitions and equations included for completeness, but never the whole picture  
-  Visual aids, examples, and code snippets where they clarify the intuition  

The goal is not to oversimplify, but to explain things in a way that makes the underlying structure transparent especially for others making the same transition.


### Current State

The notes are currently in the beginning stages and growing (albeit slower than I would like due to many concurrent projects). For an idea of what kind of explanations I am aiming for look at my notes on [HDBSCAN](notes/unsupervised_learning_models.ipynb#iii--hierarchical-density-based-spatial-clustering-of-applications-with-noise-hdbscan). I will add figures as my progress expands. For complementary code see my implementation in [clustering.py](unsupervised_learning/HDBSCAN.py).
