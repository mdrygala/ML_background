### About These Notes

I'm currently pursuing a PhD in theoretical computer science. As I started exploring machine learning, I often struggled to find resources that were both **clear and comprehensive**. Many notes were either too informal to be useful for serious understanding, or too dense to absorb quickly.

This repository is my attempt to create what I wish I had:
-  **Concise, intuitive explanations** that capture the core ideas  
-  **Formal definitions and equations** included for completeness â€” but never the starting point  
-  **Visual aids, examples, and code snippets** where they clarify the intuition  

The goal is not to oversimplify, but to explain things in a way that makes the underlying structure transparent especially for others making the same transition.
